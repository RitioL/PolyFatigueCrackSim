# PolyFatigueCrackSim
This repository contains scripts for the batch generation of polycrystalline RVE models and finite element analysis operations. These scripts are used to simulate the generation of fatigue cracks in polycrystalline materials. The involved software includes Neper, Gmsh, and Abaqus 2022.
